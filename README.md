## About

Privaxy is a MITM HTTP(s) proxy that sits in between HTTP(s) talking applications, such as a web browser and HTTP servers, such as those serving websites.

By establishing a two-way tunnel between both ends, Privaxy is able to block network requests based on URL patterns and to inject scripts as well as styles into HTML documents.

Operating at a lower level, Privaxy is both more efficient as well as more streamlined than browser add-on-based blockers. A single instance of Privaxy on a small virtual machine, server or even, on the same computer as the traffic is originating from, can filter thousands of requests per second while requiring a very small amount of memory.

Privaxy is not limited by the browserâ€™s APIs and can operate with any HTTP traffic, not only the traffic flowing from web browsers.

Privaxy is also way more capable than DNS-based blockers as it is able to operate directly on URLs and to inject resources into web pages.

## Features

- Support for uBlock origin's `js` syntax.
- Support for uBlock origin's `redirect` syntax.
- Support for uBlock origin's scriptlets.
- Browser and HTTP client agnostic.
- Support for custom filters.
- Support for excluding hosts from the MITM pipeline.
- Support for protocol upgrades, such as with websockets.
- Automatic filter lists updates.
- Very low resource usage.
  - Around 50MB of memory with approximately 320 000 filters enabled.
  - Able to filter thousands of requests per second on a small machine.
